# Digital Image Processing Labs  

Welcome to the **Digital Image Processing** repository! This repository serves as a journal and a collection of all the practical work done in the lab sessions. Each lab focuses on a core concept of digital image processing, providing a mix of theoretical understanding and hands-on implementation.  

## Journal of Labs  

### **Lab 1: MATLAB and Image Basics**  
In this session, we were introduced to MATLAB as a powerful tool for image processing. Key topics covered include:  
- Understanding MATLABâ€™s interface and basic commands for image processing.  
- Loading and displaying images using MATLAB.  
- Exploring the fundamentals of images, such as:  
  - Image dimensions and resolution.  
  - Color channels (RGB and grayscale).  
  - Reading pixel intensity values.  
- Performing basic operations like image resizing, rotation, and color-to-grayscale conversion.  

### **Lab 2: Histogram Equalization**  
This lab focused on understanding and enhancing image contrast using histogram equalization.  
- **From Scratch Implementation:**  
  - Calculating the histogram of an image.  
  - Deriving the cumulative distribution function (CDF).  
  - Mapping intensity values based on the CDF for contrast enhancement.  
- **Using MATLABâ€™s Inbuilt Function:**  
  - Leveraging MATLABâ€™s `histeq` function for quick and efficient histogram equalization.  
  - Comparing the results of the inbuilt function with the custom implementation.  

### **Lab 3: Bitplane Slicing**  
In this lab, we delved into the concept of bitplane slicing to analyze the significance of individual bits in an image:  
- Extracting and visualizing each bitplane from an 8-bit grayscale image.  
- Understanding how higher-order and lower-order bits contribute to image details.  
- Reconstructing the image using selective bitplanes to study the impact on image quality.
